# Yew-rs Homework

A homework done with Yew-rs and Tailwind CSS. It is just a blog entry about a
fake travel to Tokyo written for my English class at the university. Feel free
to use it as you want.

## Features

It uses [Yew-rs](https://yew.rs) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to
produce the page. At this moment, I have no plans to keep this work up to date,
but you can always fork it and modify it.

The colorscheme tries to mimic the
[Tokyo Night Theme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim).
